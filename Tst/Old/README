To install:
- put a link to the Singular binary to test into the current directory

To run universal tests (i.e. those with no memory or timing output)
- run "perl ./regress.cmd universal.lst"

To run specific tests:
- run "./test.cmd" <basename of test1> ... <basename of test n>

Results:
- produced output is compared with the output of corresponding *.res
  file
- progress reports and diffs (there should be none) go to stdout
- if a test fails
  (i.e. there are differences between the output and
  the corresponding .res file),
  the name of unsuccessfull test file go to stderr

To compare two versions of Singular do:

"perl compare_tst.cmd Singular1 Singular2 f1.tst f2.tst ...."

- Compares output of Singular1 with that of Singular2 when both are
  run with input fi.tst Measures time and memory consumption ---
  reports differences, as well.


"perl compare_lst.cmd Singular1 Singular2 exampleList_file.lst"

- Compares output of Singular1 with that of Singular2 when both are
  run with scripts specified in exampleList_file.lst
