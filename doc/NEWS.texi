Version 4-0-1 is a bug fix release.

@heading News for version 4-0-0

Version 4-0-0 is a milestone relase of Singular.
The new release series 4 aims for an entirely modularized architecture
simplifying connectivity with other systems and paving the way
for parallel computations.
As  a first step in modularization, the new  release features an internal
structural separation of coefficient rings and polynomial rings.
This allows for a flexible integration of new coefficient rings.

@sc{Singular} 4-0-0's list of new functionality and significant
improvements further extends that of the 3-1-6/7 prerelease series.
