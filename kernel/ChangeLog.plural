29.11.02
        ref for ncstruct introduced,
	used in extra.cc ("PLURAL"), rCopy0, rKill
	new routine ncKill

29.11.02
	qring q=system("twostd",i); is introduced and tested
	file: exterior1.tst
	todo: forbid the use of non-twosided ideals

6.12.02
	DONE: option(redTail) is implemented and tested
	file: exterior2.tst
	DONE(11.12.02) todo: in twostd, running from qring should be
	done another std() in order to get reduced result

	DONE: buckets in multiplication (p_Mult_mm, mm_Mult_p)
	version 1.17 - add cvs -m "buckets added", not
	just nCopy
	todo: syz(i) with the canonical method, think about
	Schreyer and LaScala (double homogenization)
	Print(p) at gr_kstd2.cc:877 is commented out

23.01.03-
31.01.03
	Updated multiplication:
	now we search for the shortest path with nc_uu_Mult_ww_horvert
	An old code is called nc_uu_Mult_ww_vert, is used by default.

	Further on, we should compute metrics.

	A function added:
	matrix ncMatPrint(int a, int b, ring r, int metric)
  	/* returns matrix with the info on noncomm multiplication */
Before these changes, we copied the exec to Singular.Jan.

31.01.03
	DONE syz, nres, mres;
	small problems with minres.

until
17.03.03
	fixed: minres, ideal multiplication, maps, syz
	balanced the use of buckets in mult and bracket
	added quasicommutative stuff in multiplication
	gained about 30% speedup

18.03.03
	fixed: extra "type print" in ring.cc
        new strategy of bucket used in bracket
